                <div class="postbg">
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to this new post where I'm going to finally show you the new update of Classic Style.</p>
                    <p>So... Let's start!</p>
                    <h4>Classic Style is now "Old Style"</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I thought that "Classic" doesn't fit this website as it origanlly meant to be looking like classic sites.</p>
                    <p>That's why it's now called "Old Style" which kinda makes sense to this website now.</p>
                    <p>So, Let's now see what's new with Old Style!</p>
                    <h4>What's new</h4> <br>
                    <img width="300" src="images/thenewoldstyle.png" alt="The new Old Style screenshot.">
                    <img width="300" src="images/thenewoldstyledark.png" alt="The new Old Style Dark mode screenshot."> <br> <br>
                    <p>The Old Style is now based on Version 3.0.5 with some changes that fit with the current look.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img width="300" src="images/tooltipinoldstyle.png" alt="Version 3.5 tooltip in Old Style">
                    <img width="300" src="images/tooltipinoldstyledark.png" alt="Version 3.5 tooltip dark mode in Old Style">
                    <br> <br>
                    <p>The new Old Style is also using some features from other Versions such as the tooltip from Version 3.5 <a href="posts#v3.7">That got later replaced with the latest release.</a></p>
                    <h4>Some other Changes</h4>
                    <p>- "More shortcuts" now has more buttons/options just like the regular site.</p>
                    <p>- The hover animation is not present when hovering anymore, Just like what the Classic Style was origanlly.</p>
                    <p>- Texts size is now smaller as it went to '22px' in normal texts and '26px' in main texts (In articles and footer).</p>
                    <p>- A new startup animation is present and it's similar to Version 3.5 and 3.7</p>
                    <p>- A new startup animation for the header is present and it's similar to Version 2.5's main startup animation.</p>
                    <p>- "List of my Projects, Latest Videos, Latest Tweets" Are now similar to the current ones in Version 3.7 (With the style of 3.0.5 as mentioned above).</p>
                    <p>- Footer links are now coming with texts instead of just icons.</p>
                    <h4>Release Date and Where to try</h4>
                    <del>As of the date of this post, The new Old Style will be released tomorrow if everything goes well.</del>
                    <p>You can try it now <a href="old">here</a> or simply go to /old in the link (berosato.github.io).</p>
                    <h4>That's all!</h4>
                    <p>That's all for now, Thank you for reading this post.</p>
                    <p><b>Note:</b> As of what I said in the past post, This is the last thing I would do for this website so I can focus on my future.</p>
                    <p>There would be an upcoming post which would be the last ever post in this site which I would say some things.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>See you all later!</p>

                    <h4>Where to try?</h4>
                    <p>As always, you can try it now. <a href="https://berosato.github.io">Here</a>
                    <h4>What's next?</h4>
                    <p>So... it has been a year and a half since I started working on this project for fun to try HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>After all these updates I have made, I decided to scrap it all and start from the zero again.</p>
                    <p>Why? well, I wanted to learn JavaScript for a very long time, but sadly I'm being busy with life and school sometimes which just don't give time for that... BUT! Since it's vacation now, I will start learning JavaScript soon hopefully and make a total new website with many features!</p>
                    <p>As for this current website, well, this is the actual last version. I've said it multiple times with the previous versions and that's because since I wasn't able to learn JavaScript I decided to just update my current website from time to time until I just got bored that I would actually stop updating this site.</p>
                    <p>It was kinda a great time making this site, and it's now the end.</p>
                    <h4>What about the JavaScript site?</h4>
                    <p>Since I decided to learn JavaScript (Soon!) I would make a total new website but it might not be THIS website.</p>
                    <p>Who knows, let's see what the future holds!</p>
                    <h4>Classic style is not complete</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I decided to work on it alone instead working on new versions with it.</p>
                    <p>So, I'm working on a new classic style which would be the last thing I would work on for this site.</p> <br>
                    <p>That's all, See you all later!</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>It surely looks weird but I have enjoyed the development of it!
                    (which I hope it will happen to my next projects too)</p>
                    <p>This game is just about finding stuff as well, and I might update it more if I got good ideas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Well, you might be wondering... why CopperCube engine especially?</p>
                    <p>When I first found CopperCube, I actually liked the idea of it and decided to learn it and learn other programming languages later.</p>
                    <p>I was just working on random games back there but when I started the development of The Tree World, I actually felt like it deserves to be released.</p>
                    <h4>So..... What's next?</h4>
                    <p>I might finally start learning C# (Or GDScript) to make a real game.</p>
                    <h4>News about the website</h4>
                    <del>Well... I think its current design looks good enough as I currently don't have any plans on a new design, tho I might change my mind who knows.</del>
                    <br>
                    <p>Okay, actually I've been working on Version 3.5 after I've said that lol</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is all info I have for now, enjoy playing the game!</p>

                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>so, I have finally finished the development of this website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>and now i'm planning to make some UWP apps and a game with C#</p>
                <br>
                <p>i'm currently learning JavaScript for fun, and i'm going to learn C# after that, there the development of stuff I dreamed for would start. :)</p>
                <h4>The Kart Racing Game</h4>
                <p>until I finish making some UWP apps, i'm also planning to make my own racing game that might come with PS1 style and a lot of levels and it might get multiplayer mode as well (hopefully)</p>
                <br>
                <p>Note that the game name might get changed if I find a better name. (feel free to suggest a new name for it in my twitter page)</p>
                <br>
                <p>That's all, see you later!</p>

                <h4>Other changes</h4>
                <p>1. Changed the background color of the header and footer buttons a bit in light mode</p>
                <h4>Note</h4>
                <p>
                    1. I know that I said I will use javascript in the future versions, well, I didn't since the thing I actually wanted to use with javascript looked weird so I ended up not using it. <br>
                    2. As you know, this is the final version of my website finally, I can work with other projects I wanted to make but it isn't mean the end! I might improve the website someday if I wanted to. :)

                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>I Have been working on this website for almost 1 month now,
                    I have been thinking a lot about what I should add, for now until I finish learning JavaScript,
                    The final touchs I will do for this website is: <br>
                    1. mobile menu for the header <br>
                    2. Blogs page for the website <br>
                    Hopefully I will be able to do these and the last version number will be 2.0 (newer versions will be just a
                    fix for stuff). :)</p>
