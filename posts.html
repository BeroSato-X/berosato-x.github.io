                <p>Hello!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I know, long time no see :')</p>
                <p>Though, I was recently working on a coppercube engine game for fun and I decided to release it.</p>
                <h4>Introducing... The Tree World!</h4>
                <br>
                <img width="300" src="images/thetreeworldfinalcover.png" alt="The Tree World official cover">
                <br>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/G0hDieLnmKc">Click here for the official trailer video</a>
                <a href="https://berosato.itch.io/the-tree-world">Click here for the game link</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>It surely looks weird but I have enjoyed the development of it!
                (which I hope it will happen to my next projects too)</p>
                <p>This game is just about finding stuff as well, and I might update it more if I got good ideas.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Well, you might be wondering... why CopperCube engine especially?</p>
                <p>When I first found CopperCube, I actually liked the idea of it and decided to learn it and learn other programming languages later.</p>
                <p>I was just working on random games back there but when I started the development of The Tree World, I actually felt like it deserves to be released.</p>
                <h4>So..... What's next?</h4>
                <p>I might finally start learning C# (Or GDScript) to make a real game.</p>
                <h4>News about the website</h4>
                <del>Well... I think its current design looks good enough as I currently don't have any plans on a new design, tho I might change my mind who knows.</del>
                <br>
                <p>Okay, actually I've been working on Version 3.5 after I've said that lol</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is all info I have for now, enjoy playing the game!</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>so, I have finally finished the development of this website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>and now i'm planning to make some UWP apps and a game with C#</p>
            <br>
            <p>i'm currently learning JavaScript for fun, and i'm going to learn C# after that, there the development of stuff I dreamed for would start. :)</p>
            <h4>The Kart Racing Game</h4>
            <p>until I finish making some UWP apps, i'm also planning to make my own racing game that might come with PS1 style and a lot of levels and it might get multiplayer mode as well (hopefully)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Note that the game name might get changed if I find a better name. (feel free to suggest a new name for it in my twitter page)</p>
            <br>
            <p>That's all, see you later!</p>

                1. I know that I said I will use javascript in the future versions, well, I didn't since the thing I actually wanted to use with javascript looked weird so I ended up not using it. <br>
                2. As you know, this is the final version of my website finally, I can work with other projects I wanted to make but it isn't mean the end! I might improve the website someday if I wanted to. :)

            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I Have been working on this website for almost 1 month now,
                I have been thinking a lot about what I should add, for now until I finish learning JavaScript,
                The final touchs I will do for this website is: <br>
                1. mobile menu for the header <br>
                2. Blogs page for the website <br>
                Hopefully I will be able to do these and the last version number will be 2.0 (newer versions will be just a
                fix for stuff). :)</p>
